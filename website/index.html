				<p><strong>Five-elements Theory</strong>, or <strong>Wuxing</strong> (“five processes”, “five phases” of “five elements”) refers to a fivefold conceptual scheme that is found throughout traditional Chinese thought. These five phases are wood, fire, earth, metal, and water; they are regarded as dynamic, interdependent modes or aspects of the universe’s ongoing existence and development.   
				</p>

				<p>Although this fivefold scheme resembles ancient Greek discourse about the four elements, these Chinese “elements” are seen as ever-changing material forces, while the Greek elements typically are regarded as unchanging building blocks of matter.
				</p>

				<p>Since of the Han dynasty (202 B.C.E.-220 C.E.), the wuxing system has been applied to the explanation of natural phenomena and extended to the description of aesthetic principles, historical events, political structures, and social norms, among other things. Cosmology, morality, and medicine remain the chief arenas of wuxing thought, but virtually every aspect of Chinese life has been touched by it.  As such, wuxing has come to be inseparable from Chineseness itself and belongs to no single stream of classical Chinese philosophy.</p>

	<h2>Five Elements Personality Type</h2>
	<!-- use image home_bg_02.jpg as background-->
	

	<p>People can be ‘classified’ according to the five-element theory. Their body structure, tendencies, temperaments, emotions, positive and negative behaviour, moods and illnesses can all be looked at in relation to the five elements. We are all part of nature, the seasons, the Heaven and the Earth and therefore we are not a manifestation of only one element but of all of them. What makes us different from one another (amongst other things) is which of the elements is more or less dominant in relation to the others.
	</p>

	<p>It is good to keep in mind, that each element can manifest in both positive and negative tendencies, depending upon the state of health and balance in the person at the time.Take the quizz below to find your dominant element according to Traditional Chinese Philosophy.
