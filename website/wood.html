	<p><strong>Wood</strong> is the most human of the elements. It is the element of spring; the creative urge to achieve - which can turn to anger when frustrated. It is associated with the capacity to look forward, plan and make decisions, hence growth and expansion.</p>

	<p>It is also associated with qualities of generosity and idealism. One quality of the Wood element is leadership. It is the leader within us, that can take charge and determine a plan of action. The wood is one that seeks always to grow and expand. Wood heralds the beginning of life, springtime and buds, sensuality and fecundity. </p>

	<h2>Wood Personality Type</h2>
	<h3>Archetype: The Pioneer and Strategist/Directing</h3>

	<img src="img/wood_pic_1">
	<p>Wood-type people are kind, steady, sympathy-sharing, understanding and gentle. They like to help people and make donations. The essence of Wood is a tree. The force inside the tree is like growing upward to the sky. Trees often compete with each other aggressively when growing up.</p>

	<p>Because of the characteristics of trees, Wood-type people are steadfast, organized, logical, practical, innovative, unique, assertive, fortitudinous, independent, challenging and direct. They like to plan things, take action, and go on adventures and challenges. They are perfectionists who tend to push themselves to the limit and seek out the best, and take first place in competition. When their ambition and optimism is overwhelming, Wood-types can become upset, nervous, unstable, impatient, intolerant, and lose their humor by the frustration of many obstacles.</p>

	<p>People lacking Wood essentially are weak in their opinions. They lack the determination to change their options when situations change. They are likely to be jealous when they don't have a strong viewpoint of their own.</p>

	<p>People with excess Wood are often inflexible, prejudiced and biased. They tend not to accept or absorb others' opinions.</p>


	<!-- Cycles -->

	<h2>Cycles</h2>
	<p>The doctrine of five phases describes two cycles, a generating or creation (生, shēng) cycle, also known as "mother-son", and an overcoming or destruction (剋/克, kè) cycle, also known as "grandfather-nephew", of interactions between the phases.</p>
